    # idle() function in order to update the view during the resize.  So we
    # override this method, called by the resizing event loop, and call the
    # idle() function from here.  This *almost* works.  I can't figure out what
    # is happening at the very beginning of a resize event.  The NSView's
    # viewWillStartLiveResize method is called and then nothing happens until
    # the mouse is dragged.  I think NSApplication's nextEventMatchingMask_etc
    # method is being called instead of this one.  I don't really feel like
    # subclassing NSApplication just to fix this.  Also, to prevent white flashes
    # while resizing, we must also call idle() from the view's reshape method.
