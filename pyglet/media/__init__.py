"""Audio and video playback.

pyglet can play WAV files, and if FFmpeg is installed, many other audio and
video formats.

Playback is handled by the :class:`.Player` class, which reads raw data from
:class:`Source` objects and provides methods for pausing, seeking, adjusting
the volume, and so on. The :class:`.Player` class implements the best
available audio device. ::

    player = Player()

A :class:`Source` is used to decode arbitrary audio and video files. It is
associated with a single player by "queueing" it::

    source = load('background_music.mp3')
    player.queue(source)

Use the :class:`.Player` to control playback.

If the source contains video, the :py:meth:`Source.video_format` attribute
will be non-None, and the :py:attr:`Player.texture` attribute will contain the
current video image synchronised to the audio.

Decoding sounds can be processor-intensive and may introduce latency,
particularly for short sounds that must be played quickly, such as bullets or
explosions. You can force such sounds to be decoded and retained in memory
rather than streamed from disk by wrapping the source in a
:class:`StaticSource`::

    bullet_sound = StaticSource(load('bullet.wav'))

The other advantage of a :class:`StaticSource` is that it can be queued on
any number of players, and so played many times simultaneously.

Pyglet relies on Python's garbage collector to release resources when a player
has finished playing a source. In this way some operations that could affect
the application performance can be delayed.

The player provides a :py:meth:`Player.delete` method that can be used to
release resources immediately.
