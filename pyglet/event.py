"""Event dispatch framework.

All objects that produce events in pyglet implement :py:class:`~pyglet.event.EventDispatcher`,
providing a consistent interface for registering and manipulating event
handlers.  A commonly used event dispatcher is `pyglet.window.Window`.

Event types
===========

For each event dispatcher there is a set of events that it dispatches; these
correspond with the type of event handlers you can attach.  Event types are
identified by their name, for example, ''on_resize''.

If you are creating a new class which implements
:py:class:`~pyglet.event.EventDispatcher`, or want to add new events
to an existing dispatcher, you must call `EventDispatcher.register_event_type`
for each event type:

    class MyDispatcher(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        # ...

    MyDispatcher.register_event_type('on_resize')

Attaching event handlers
========================

An event handler is simply a function or method, that is called when system or
program event happens. There are several ways to add a handler for an event.

When the dispatcher object is available as a global variable, it is convenient
to use the `event` decorator:

    @window.event
    def on_resize(width, height):
        # ...

Here `window` is a variable containing an instance of `pyglet.window.Window`,
which inherits from `EventDispatcher` class. This decorator assumes that
the function is named after the event. To use the decorator with a function with
another name, pass the name of the event as the argument for the decorator:

    @window.event('on_resize')
    def my_resize_handler(width, height);
        # ...

The most universal way to add an event handler is to call the `push_handlers`
method on the dispatcher object:

    window.push_handlers(on_resize)
    window.push_handlers(on_resize=my_handler)
    window.push_handlers(on_resize=obj.my_handler)
    window.push_handlers(obj)

This methods accepts both positional and keyword parameters. In case of keyword
arguments, the name of the event matches the name of the argument. Otherwise,
the name of the passed function or method is used as the event name.

If an object is passed as a positional argument, all its methods that match
the names of registered events are added as handlers. For example:

    class MyDispatcher(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        # ...
    MyDispatcher.register_event_type('on_resize')
    MyDispatcher.register_event_type('on_keypress')

    class Listener(object):
        def on_resize(self, w, h):
            # ...

        def on_keypress(self, key):
            # ...

        def other_method(self):
            # ...

    dispatcher = MyDispatcher()
    listener = Listener()
    dispatcher.push_handlers(listener)

In this example both `listener.on_resize` and `listener.on_keypress` are
registered as handlers for respective events, but `listener.other_method` is
not affected, because it doesn't correspond to a registered event type.

Finally, yet another option is to subclass the dispatcher and override the event
handler methods::

    class MyDispatcher(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        def on_resize(self, width, height):
            # ...

If both a parent class and the child class have a handler for the same event,
only the child's version of the method is invoked. If both event handlers are
needed, the child's handler must explicitly call the parent's handler:

    class ParentDispatcher(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        def on_resize(self, w, h);
            # ...

    class ChildDispatcher(ParentDispatcher):
        def on_resize(self, w, h):
            super().on_resize(w, h)
            # ...

Multiple handlers for an event
==============================

A single event can be handled by multiple handlers. The handlers are invoked in
the order opposite to the order of their registration. So, the handler
registered last will be the first to be invoke when the event is fired.

An event handler can return the value `pyglet.event.EVENT_HANDLED` to prevent
running the subsequent handlers. Alternatively if the handle returns
`pyglet.event.EVENT_UNHANDLED` or doesn't return an explicit value, the next
event handler will be called (if there is one).

Stopping the event propagation is useful to prevent a single user action from
being handled by two unrelated systems. For instance, in game using WASD keys
for movement, should suppress movement when a chat window is opened: the
"keypress" event should be handled by the chat or by the character
movement system, but not both.

The order of execution of event handlers can be changed by assigning them
priority. Default priority for all handlers is 0. If handler needs to be run
before other handlers even though it was added early, it can be assigned
priority 1. Conversely, a handler added late can be assigned priority -1 to be
run late.

Priority can be assigned by passing the `priority` named parameter to
`push_handlers` method:

    window.push_handlers(on_resize, priority=-1)

It can also be specified by using the `@priority` decorators on handler
functions and methods:

    @pyglet.event.priority(1)
    def on_resize(w, h):
        # ...

    class Listener(object):
        @pyglet.event.priority(-1)
        def on_resize(self, w, h):
            # ...
    listener = Listener()

    dispatcher.push_handlers(on_resize, listener)

Removing event handlers
=======================

In most cases it is not necessary to remove event handlers manually. When
the handler is an object method, the event dispatcher keeps only a weak
reference to it. It means, that the dispatcher will not prevent the object from
being deleted when it goes out of scope. In that case the handler will be
silently removed from the list of handlers.

.. note::

    This means the following example will not work, because the pushed object
    will fall out of scope and be collected::

        dispatcher.push_handlers(MyHandlerClass())

    Instead, you must make sure to keep a reference to the object before pushing
    it. For example::

        my_handler_instance = MyHandlerClass()
        dispatcher.push_handlers(my_handler_instance)

When explicit removal of handlers is required, the method `remove_handlers`
can be used. Its arguments are the same as the arguments of `push_handlers`:

    dispatcher.remove_handlers(on_resize)
    dispatcher.remove_handlers(on_resize=my_handler)
    dispatcher.remove_handlers(on_resize=obj.my_handler)
    dispatcher.remove_handlers(obj)

When an object is passed as a positional parameter to `remove_handlers`, all its
methods are removed from the handlers, regardless of their names.

Dispatching events
==================

pyglet uses a single-threaded model for all application code. Normally event
handlers are invoked while running an event loop by calling

    pyglet.app.run()

or

    event_loop = pyglet.app.EventLoop()
    event_loop.run()

Application code can invoke events directly by calling the method
`dispatch_event` of `EventDispatcher`:

    dispatcher.dispatch_event('on_resize', 640, 480)

The first argument of this method is the event name, that has to be previously
registered using `register_event_type` class method. The rest of the arguments
are pass to event handlers.

The handlers of an event fired by calling `dispatch_event` are called directly
from this method. If any of the handlers returns `EVENT_HANDLED`, then
`dispatch_event` also returns `EVENT_HANDLED` otherwise (or if there weren't
any handlers for a given event) it returns `EVENT_UNHANDLED`.
