"""Precise framerate calculation, scheduling and framerate limiting.

Measuring time
==============

The `tick` and `get_fps` functions can be used in conjunction to fulfil most
games' basic requirements::

    from pyglet import clock
    while True:
        dt = clock.tick()
        # ... update and render ...
        print 'FPS is %f' % clock.get_fps()

The ``dt`` value returned gives the number of seconds (as a float) since the
last "tick".

The `get_fps` function averages the framerate over a sliding window of
approximately 1 second.  (You can calculate the instantaneous framerate by
taking the reciprocal of ``dt``).

Always remember to `tick` the clock!

Limiting frame-rate
===================

The framerate can be limited::

    clock.set_fps_limit(60)

This causes :py:class:`~pyglet.clock.Clock` to sleep during each `tick` in an
attempt to keep the number of ticks (frames) per second below 60.

The implementation uses platform-dependent high-resolution sleep functions
to achieve better accuracy with busy-waiting than would be possible using
just the `time` module.

Scheduling
==========

You can schedule a function to be called every time the clock is ticked::

    def callback(dt):
        print '%f seconds since last callback' % dt

    clock.schedule(callback)

The `schedule_interval` method causes a function to be called every "n"
seconds::

    clock.schedule_interval(callback, .5)   # called twice a second

The `schedule_once` method causes a function to be called once "n" seconds
in the future::

    clock.schedule_once(callback, 5)        # called in 5 seconds

All of the `schedule` methods will pass on any additional args or keyword args
you specify to the callback function::

    def animate(dt, velocity, sprite):
       sprite.position += dt * velocity

    clock.schedule(animate, velocity=5.0, sprite=alien)

You can cancel a function scheduled with any of these methods using
`unschedule`::

    clock.unschedule(animate)

Displaying FPS
==============

The ClockDisplay class provides a simple FPS counter.  You should create
an instance of ClockDisplay once during the application's start up::

    fps_display = clock.ClockDisplay()

Call draw on the ClockDisplay object for each frame::

    fps_display.draw()

There are several options to change the font, color and text displayed
within the __init__ method.

Using multiple clocks
=====================

The clock functions are all relayed to an instance of
:py:class:`~pyglet.clock.Clock` which is initialised with the module.  You can
get this instance to use directly::

    clk = clock.get_default()

You can also replace the default clock with your own:

    myclk = clock.Clock()
    clock.set_default(myclk)

Each clock maintains its own set of scheduled functions and FPS
limiting/measurement.  Each clock must be "ticked" separately.

Multiple and derived clocks potentially allow you to separate "game-time" and
"wall-time", or to synchronise your clock to an audio or video stream instead
of the system clock.
