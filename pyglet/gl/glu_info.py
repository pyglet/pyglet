"""Information about version and extensions of current GLU implementation.

If multiple contexts are in use you can use a separate GLUInfo object for each
context.  Call `set_active_context` after switching to the desired context for
each GLUInfo::

    info = GLUInfo()
    info.set_active_context()

created.
