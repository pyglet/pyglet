    and digital joysticks, gamepads, game controllers, and possibly even
    steering wheels and other input devices.  There is unfortunately no way to
    distinguish between these different device types.

    To use a joystick, first call `open`, then in your game loop examine
    the values of `x`, `y`, and so on.  These values are normalized to the
    range [-1.0, 1.0]. 

    To receive events when the value of an axis changes, attach an 
    on_joyaxis_motion event handler to the joystick.  The :py:class:`~pyglet.input.Joystick` instance,
    axis name, and current value are passed as parameters to this event.

    To handle button events, you should attach on_joybutton_press and 
    on_joy_button_release event handlers to the joystick.  Both the :py:class:`~pyglet.input.Joystick`
    instance and the index of the changed button are passed as parameters to 
    these events.

    Alternately, you may attach event handlers to each individual button in 
    `button_controls` to receive on_press or on_release events.
    
    To use the hat switch, attach an on_joyhat_motion event handler to the
    joystick.  The handler will be called with both the hat_x and hat_y values
    whenever the value of the hat switch changes.

    The device name can be queried to get the name of the joystick.

    :Ivariables:
        `device` : `Device`
            The underlying device used by this joystick interface.
        `x` : float

            Current y (vertical) value ranging from -1.0 (top) to 1.0
            (bottom).
        `z` : float
            Current Z value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.  On joysticks the Z
            value is usually the throttle control.  On game controllers the Z
            value is usually the secondary thumb vertical axis.
        `rx` : float
            Current rotational X value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.
        `ry` : float
            Current rotational Y value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.
        `rz` : float
            Current rotational Z value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.  On joysticks
            the RZ value is usually the twist of the stick.  On game
            controllers the RZ value is usually the secondary thumb horizontal
            axis.
        `hat_x` : int

            (centered) or 1 (top).
        `buttons` : list of bool
            List of boolean values representing current states of the buttons.

            and so on.
