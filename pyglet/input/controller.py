"""Game Controller support.

This module provides an interface for Game Controller devices, which are a
subset of Joysticks. Game Controllers have consistent button and axis mapping,
which resembles common dual-stick home video game console controllers.
Devices that are of this design can be automatically mapped to the "virtual"
Game Controller layout, providing a consistent abstraction for a large number
of different devices, with no tedious button and axis mapping for each one.
To achieve this, an internal mapping database contains lists of device ids
and their corresponding button and axis mappings. The mapping database is in
the same format as originated by the `SDL` library, which has become a
semi-standard and is in common use. Most popular controllers are included in
the built-in database, and additional mappings can be added at runtime.


Some Joysticks, such as Flight Sticks, etc., do not necessarily fit into the
layout (and limitations) of GameControllers. For those such devices, it is
recommended to use the Joystick interface instead.

To query which GameControllers are available, call :py:func:`get_controllers`.
