"""Minimal Windows COM interface.

Allows pyglet to use COM interfaces on Windows without comtypes.  Unlike
comtypes, this module does not provide property interfaces, read typelibs,
nice-ify return values.  We don't need anything that sophisticated to work with COM's.

Interfaces should derive from pIUnknown if their implementation is returned by the COM.
The Python COM interfaces are actually pointers to the implementation (take note
when translating methods that take an interface as argument).
(example: A Double Pointer is simply POINTER(MyInterface) as pInterface is already a POINTER.)

Interfaces can define methods::

    class IDirectSound8(com.pIUnknown):
        _methods_ = [
            ('CreateSoundBuffer', com.STDMETHOD()),
            ('GetCaps', com.STDMETHOD(LPDSCAPS)),
            ...
        ]

Only use STDMETHOD or METHOD for the method types (not ordinary ctypes
function types).  The 'this' pointer is bound automatically... e.g., call::

    device = IDirectSound8()
    DirectSoundCreate8(None, ctypes.byref(device), None)

    caps = DSCAPS()
    device.GetCaps(caps)

Because STDMETHODs use HRESULT as the return type, there is no need to check
the return value.

Don't forget to manually manage memory... call Release() when you're done with
an interface.
