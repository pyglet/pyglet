"""Display and screen management.

Rendering is performed on a :class:`Canvas`, which conceptually could be an
off-screen buffer, the content area of a :class:`pyglet.window.Window`, or an
entire screen. Currently, canvases can only be created with windows (though
windows can be set fullscreen).

Windows and canvases must belong to a :class:`Display`. On Windows and Mac OS X
there is only one display, which can be obtained with :func:`get_display`.
Linux supports multiple displays, corresponding to discrete X11 display
connections and screens.  :func:`get_display` on Linux returns the default
display and screen 0 (``localhost:0.0``); if a particular screen or display is
required then :class:`Display` can be instantiated directly.

Within a display one or more screens are attached.  A :class:`Screen` often
corresponds to a physical attached monitor, however a monitor or projector set
up to clone another screen will not be listed.  Use :meth:`Display.get_screens`
to get a list of the attached screens; these can then be queried for their
sizes and virtual positions on the desktop.

The size of a screen is determined by its current mode, which can be changed
by the application; see the documentation for :class:`Screen`.
