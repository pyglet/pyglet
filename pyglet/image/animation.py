"""2D Animations

Animations can be used by the :py:class:`~pyglet.sprite.Sprite` class in place
of static images. They are essentially containers for individual image frames,
with a duration per frame. They can be infinitely looping, or stop at the last
frame. You can load Animations from disk, such as from GIF files::

    ani = pyglet.resource.animation('walking.gif')
    sprite = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(img=ani)

Alternatively, you can create your own Animations from a sequence of images
by using the :py:meth:`~Animation.from_image_sequence` method::

    images = [pyglet.resource.image('walk_a.png'),
              pyglet.resource.image('walk_b.png'),
              pyglet.resource.image('walk_c.png')]

    ani = pyglet.image.Animation.from_image_sequence(images, duration=0.1, loop=True)

You can also use an :py:class:`pyglet.image.ImageGrid`, which is iterable::

    sprite_sheet = pyglet.resource.image('my_sprite_sheet.png')
    image_grid = pyglet.image.ImageGrid(sprite_sheet, rows=1, columns=5)

    ani = pyglet.image.Animation.from_image_sequence(image_grid, duration=0.1)

In the above examples, all of the Animation Frames have the same duration.
If you wish to adjust this, you can manually create the Animation from a list of
:py:class:`~AnimationFrame`::

    image_a = pyglet.resource.image('walk_a.png')
    image_b = pyglet.resource.image('walk_b.png')
    image_c = pyglet.resource.image('walk_c.png')

    frame_a = pyglet.image.AnimationFrame(image_a, duration=0.1)
    frame_b = pyglet.image.AnimationFrame(image_b, duration=0.2)
    frame_c = pyglet.image.AnimationFrame(image_c, duration=0.1)

    ani = pyglet.image.Animation(frames=[frame_a, frame_b, frame_c])
