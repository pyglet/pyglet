Sound Space
===========

This is a toy program for playing with positional audio in pyglet
(http://www.pyglet.org).  On Linux, OpenAL is required.

The source code is licensed under the BSD license, which is quite permissive
(see the source headers for details).

Audio samples were generated with Apple GarageBand.

Usage
-----

Run the toy with::

    python soundspace.py

Everything is controlled with the mouse.  Hover over a control to
see its name.  Click and drag an empty area to pan the view, and scroll the
scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

The red triangles can be dragged to move the position of a player or listener.

The dashed line to the yellow handle shows the cone orientation; this can be
reoriented by dragging it.

The blue and green segments represent the outer and inner cone angles,
respectively.  You can resize the angle by dragging the handle attached to the
cone.

There is a master volume control beneath the listener.

Click the (+) sign on a player to show the min_gain, max_gain, cone_outer_gain
and volume controls.

The initial configuration is given in res/space.txt; it should be
self-explanatory (parsed by reader.py).
