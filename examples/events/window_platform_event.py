"""Demonstrates how to handle a platform-specific event not defined in
pyglet by subclassing Window.  This is not for the faint-hearted!

A message will be printed to stdout when the following events are caught:

 - On Mac OS X, the window drag region is clicked.
 - On Windows, the display resolution is changed.
 - On Linux, the window properties are changed.
