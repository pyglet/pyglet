OpenGL Interface
================

pyglet provides an interface to OpenGL and GLU.  The interface is used by all
of pyglet's higher-level API's, so that all rendering is done efficiently by
the graphics card, rather than the operating system.  You can access this
interface directly; using it is much like using OpenGL from C.

The interface is a "thin-wrapper" around ``libGL.so`` on Linux,
``opengl32.dll`` on Windows and ``OpenGL.framework`` on OS X.  The pyglet
maintainers regenerate the interface from the latest specifications, so it is
always up-to-date with the latest version and almost all extensions.

The interface is provided by the ``pyglet.gl`` package.  To use it you will
need a good knowledge of OpenGL, C and ctypes.  You may prefer to use OpenGL
without using ctypes, in which case you should investigate `PyOpenGL`_.
`PyOpenGL`_ provides similar functionality with a more "Pythonic" interface,
and will work with pyglet without any modification.

Using OpenGL
------------

Documentation of OpenGL and GLU are provided at the `OpenGL website`_ and
(more comprehensively) in the `OpenGL Programming Guide`_.

Importing the package gives access to OpenGL, GLU, and all OpenGL registered
extensions.   This is sufficient for all but the most advanced uses of
OpenGL::

    from pyglet.gl import *

All function names and constants are identical to the C counterparts.  For
example, the following program draws a triangle on the screen::

    from pyglet.gl import *
    from pyglet.window import *

    # The OpenGL context is created only when you create a window.  Any calls
    # to OpenGL before a window is created will fail.
    window = Window(visible=False)

    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)
    glOrtho(0, window.width, 0, window.height, -1, 1)
    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)

    window.set_visible()
    while not window.has_exit:
        window.dispatch_events()

        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
        glLoadIdentity()
        glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES)
        glVertex2f(0, 0)
        glVertex2f(window.width, 0)
        glVertex2f(window.width, window.height)
        glEnd()

        window.flip()

You can set the attributes of the OpenGL context when you create the window.
For example, to ensure there is a stencil buffer::

    window = Window(stencil_size=8)

By default, windows are created with a depth buffer and two colour buffers
(double-buffered).  See the `pyglet.window` documentation for complete
reference.  If you are using a double-buffer, remember to call
``window.flip()`` to swap the buffers after every frame.

Resizing the window
-------------------

If you try to resize the window created in the example above, you will notice
that the triangle does not continue filling the area.  This is because pyglet
will automatically call ``glViewport`` so that the whole window area is used
when a window is resized, but does not change the projection matrix.

Most OpenGL applications that use a resizeable window should recreate the
projection matrix when the window is resized::

    def on_resize(width, height):
        glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)
        glLoadIdentity()
        glOrtho(0, width, 0, height, -1, 1)
        glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)

    window.push_handlers(on_resize)

Error checking
--------------

By default, pyglet calls ``glGetError`` after every GL function call (except
where such a check would be invalid).  If an error is reported, pyglet raises
``GLException`` with the result of ``gluErrorString`` as the message.

This is very handy during development, as it catches common coding errors
early on.  However, it has a significant impact on performance.  You can
disable this error check by setting the following option `before` importing
``pyglet.gl`` or ``pyglet.window``::

    # Disable error checking for increased performance
    from pyglet import options
    options['gl_error_check'] = False

    from pyglet.gl import *

Setting the option after importing ``pyglet.gl`` will have no effect.  Once
disabled, there is no overhead in each GL call.

Using extension functions
-------------------------

Before using an extension function, you should check that the extension is
implemented by the current driver.  Typically this is done using
``glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)``, but pyglet has a convenience module,
`pyglet.gl.gl_info` that does this for you::

    from pyglet.gl.gl_info import *

    if gl_info.have_extension('GL_ARB_shadow'):
        # ... do shadow-related code.
    else:
        # ... raise an exception, or use a fallback method

Note that the module ``gl_info`` exports an object also named ``gl_info``,
through which you interact.  You can also easily check the version of
OpenGL::

    if gl_info.have_version(1,5):
        # We can assume all OpenGL 1.5 functions are implemented.

Remember to only call the ``gl_info`` functions after creating a window.

There is a corresponding ``glu_info`` module for checking the version and
extensions of GLU.

nVidia often release hardware with extensions before having them registered
officially.  When you ``import * from pyglet.gl`` you import only the
registered extensions.  You can import the latest nVidia extensions
with::

    from pyglet.gl.glext_nv import *

Using multiple windows
----------------------

pyglet allows you to create and display any number of windows simultaneously.
Each will be created with its own OpenGL context, however all contexts will
share the same texture objects, display lists, shader programs, and so on [#]_.
Each context has its own state and framebuffers.

.. [#] Sometimes objects and lists cannot be shared between contexts; for
       example, when the contexts are provided by different video devices.
       This will usually only occur if you explicitly select different screens
       driven by different devices.

There is always an active context (unless there are no windows).  By default,
the active context belongs to whichever window was displayed last.  This works
well if there is only ever one window visible at a time.  If there are more,
you need to explicitly set the active context when you start drawing.  You can
do this by calling the window's ``switch_to`` method::

    window_1 = Window()
    window_2 = Window()

    while running:
        window_1.dispatch_events()
        window_2.dispatch_events()

        # Draw the contents of window_1:
        window_1.switch_to()
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
        # ...
        window_1.flip()

        window_2.switch_to()
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
        # ...
        window_2.flip()

AGL, GLX and WGL
----------------

The OpenGL context itself is managed by an operating-system specific library:
AGL on OS X, GLX under X11 and WGL on Windows.  pyglet handles these details
when a window is created, but you may need to use the functions directly (for
example, to use pbuffers) or an extension function.

The modules are named ``pyglet.gl.agl``, ``pyglet.gl.glx`` and
``pyglet.gl.wgl``.  You must only import the correct module for the running
operating system::

    if sys.platform == 'linux2':
        from pyglet.gl.glx import *
        glxCreatePbuffer(...)
    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':
        from pyglet.gl.agl import *
        aglCreatePbuffer(...)

There are convenience modules for querying the version and extensions of WGL
and GLX named ``pyglet.gl.wgl_info`` and ``pyglet.gl.glx_info``, respectively.
AGL does not have such a module, just query the version of OS X instead.

If using GLX extensions, you can import ``pyglet.gl.glxext_abi`` for the
registered extensions or ``pyglet.gl.glxext_nv`` for the latest nVidia
extensions.

Similarly, if using WGL extensions, import ``pyglet.gl.wglext_abi`` or
``pyglet.gl.wglext_nv``.
