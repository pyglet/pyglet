pyglet Documentation
====================

**pyglet** is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python,
intended for developing games and other visually rich applications. It supports
windowing, user interface event handling, OpenGL graphics, loading images
and videos, and playing sounds and music. **pyglet** works on Windows, OS X
and Linux.

Some of the features of pyglet are:

* **No external dependencies or installation requirements.** For most 
  application and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python,
  simplifying distribution and installation.
* **Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops.** pyglet
  allows you to use as many windows as you need, and is fully aware of
  multi-monitor setups for use with fullscreen games and applications.
* **Load images, sound, music and video in almost any format.** pyglet can
  optionally use AVbin to play back audio formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and
  WMA, and video formats such as DivX, MPEG-2, H.264, WMV and Xvid.
* **pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license**, allowing you to 
  use it for both commercial and other open-source projects with very little
  restriction.
* **Supports Python 2 and 3.** Pick your favorite!

Third party libraries
---------------------

Listed here are a few third party libraries that you might find useful when
developing your project.  Please direct any questions to the respective authors.
If you would like to have your library listed here, let us know!

`glooey -  An object-oriented GUI library for pyglet <http://glooey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
    Every game needs a user interface that matches its look and feel. The purpose of glooey
    is to help you make such an interface.  Towards this end, glooey provides 7 powerful
    placement widgets, a label widget, an image widget, 3 different button widgets, a text
    entry widget, a variety of scroll boxes and bars, 4 different dialog box widgets, and a
    variety of other miscellaneous widgets.  The appearance of any widget can be trivially
    customized, and glooey comes with built-in fantasy, puzzle, and 8-bit themes to prove it
    (and to help you hit the ground running if your game fits one of those genres).

`PyShaders - Pythonic OpenGL shader wrapper for python <https://github.com/gabdube/pyshaders>`_
    Pyshaders aims to completely wraps the opengl2.1 shader api in a python module.
    Pyshaders provides a pythonic OOP api that hides the lower level (ctypes) calls.
    Pyshaders provides a high level api and a low level api, and it can be integrated easily
    with existing code because it does not occlude the underlying opengl values.

Projects based on pyglet
------------------------

pyglet is a fairly lightweight library, which makes it ideal to build upon.  Listed here are
a few projects that take advantage of pyglet "under the hood".  If you would like to have your
project listed here, let us know!
