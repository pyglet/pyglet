Development environment
=======================
To develop pyglet, you need an environment with at least the following:
   - python 2.7
   - python 3.4 and/or 3.5
   - py.test
   - Your favorite Python editor or IDE

Optionally you should also have:
   - AVbin
   - Pillow
   - coverage

It is preferred to create a virtual Python environment to develop in. It allows you to
easily test on all Python version supported by pyglet, not pollute your local system
with pyglet development dependencies and not have your local system interfere with
pyglet developement. This section will show you how to set up a virtual environment
for developing pyglet.

Linux or Mac OSX
----------------
Setting up
''''''''''
Setting up a virtual environment is almost the same for Linux and OSX. First use your
OS's package manager (apt, brew, etc) to install the following dependencies:
   - Python 2.7
   - Python 3.4 and/or 3.5
   - pip (for each version of Python)

[Optional] Make sure pip is the latest version (you might need to add sudo)::

   pip install --upgrade pip

Install virtualenv to create virtual environments (you might need to add sudo)::

   pip install virtualenv

Make a directory to hold our virtual environments::

   mkdir venv

Now repeat the following steps for each version of Python.

Create a virtual environment (substitute the version number for the version of Python
you are creating the environment for::

   virtualenv -p python2.7 venv/py27

Activate the virtual environment::

   . venv/py27/bin/activate

You will see the name of the virtual environment at the start of the command prompt.

Now install required dependencies::

   pip install pytest

And optional dependencies::

   pip install pytest-cov Pillow

Using
'''''
To switch to a virtual environment run the following::

   . venv/<name of environment>/bin/activate

E.g.::

   . venv/py34/bin/activate

To get out of the virtual environment run::

   deactivate

Windows
-------
Setting up
''''''''''
Make sure you download and install:
   - Python 2.7
   - Python 3.4 and/or 3.5

Pip should installed automatically with the latest Python installers. Make sure you do not
choose to not install pip.

Now open a command prompt. Repeat the following steps for each version of Python (replace 2.7 with
the version you want to use).

[Optional] Make sure pip is the latest version::

   py -2.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install virtualenv to create virtual environments::

   py -2.7 -m pip install virtualenv

Make a directory to hold our virtual environments::

   md venv

Create a virtual environment (substitute the version number for the version of Python
you are creating the environment for::

   py -2.7 -m virtualenv venv\py27

Activate the virtual environment::

   venv\py27\Scripts\activate

You will see the name of the virtual environment at the start of the command prompt.

Now install required dependencies::

   pip install pytest

And optional dependencies::

   pip install pytest-cov Pillow

Using
'''''
To switch to a virtual environment run the following::

   venv\<name of environment>\Scripts\activate

E.g.::

   venv\py34\Scripts\activate

To get out of the virtual environment run::

   deactivate
