Making a pyglet release
-----------------------

1. hg pull -u
2. Update version string in setup.py, pyglet/__init__.py and CHANGELOG
   Update README, and the two readme.rtf files on Windows and Mac.
3. hg push
4. Mac OS X release (requires OS X 10.5 and developer tools installed)::

           sudo tools/genmpkg/genmpkg.sh

   Creates .dmg in dist/

   NOTE for 10.5:  bdist_mpkg doesn't quite work, needs a hack to avoid
   doing the admin write check (you'll see when you get the
   traceback).

5. Windows release (requires WIX 3.0.  WIX bin/ must be in PATH)::

        python tools/genmsi/genmsi.py
  
   Creates .msi in dist/

6. Linux - You will need docutils, the docbook writer from the docutils sandbox, inkscape, fop, docbook-xsl, and perhaps more:

   	./make.py clean ; ./make.py docs

   Creates doc package in dist/

7. Source, egg and doc releases:

        tools/gendist.sh

   Creates .eggs, .tar.gzs and .zips in dist/

8. Upload files to googlecode::

        python tools/upload/upload.py

9. svn copy https://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
            https://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/tags/pyglet-**VERSION**
10. Copy URLs reported from upload into website/download.xml
11. Add news item to website/news-items.xml
12. Regenerate website with tools/genwebsite.sh
13. Update pyglet.org from website/dist/ to /: 
      download.html, news.html, news.xml, index.html
    From doc/ to doc/:
      html/api/*,  html/programming_guide/*
      pdf/programming_guide.pdf
14. python setup.py register
15. Tell people!

Untested AFAIK:
  * Source distros on any platform
  * Eggs on any platform: both to be installed and without installation
    ('require')
  * Windows Vista
  * Upgrade of Mac OS X install (after changing version string to beta, etc)
  * Mac OS X with Python 2.4 + ctypes (ctypes didn't compile on my mac).
  * Mac OS X 10.3
