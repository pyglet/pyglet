Migrating from pyglet 2.0
=========================
This page will help you upgrade your project from pyglet 2.0.

Some of pyglet 2.1's improvements required small breaking changes,
including:

* Arguments for text, UI, and game controller handling
* Locations and names for features
* Data types and annotations
* Changes to math classes

To report a missing change or a bug, please use `GitHub Issues`_ or

.. _migration-options:

Setting pyglet Options
----------------------

The :py:attr:`pyglet.options` attribute is now a :py:class:`pyglet.Options` instance.

The Options Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although :py:class:`~pyglet.Options` is a :py:func:`dataclass <dataclasses.dataclass>`,
you can get and set its attribute values directly via either approach below::

    # "New" 2.1 attribute-style works with type checkers
    pyglet.options.dpi_scaling = 'real'

    # "Old" dict-style access is backward-compatible to helpe with porting
    pyglet.options['dpi_scaling'] = 'real'


Window "HiDPI" support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In 2.1, :py:attr:`pyglet.options.dpi_scaling <pyglet.Options.dpi_scaling>`
accepts strings to configure fine-grained 'HiDPI' behavior.

What is HiDPI?
""""""""""""""
Some systems require scaled drawing due to pixel density, settings, or both.

.. note:: HiDPI stands for High Dots Per *(Square)* Inch.

In practice, this usually means:

* Apple's "retina" displays on Macs
* Non-Mac displays branded as 4K, 8K, etc
* Other displays with non-100% zoom or scaling

Scaling Modes
"""""""""""""
The pyglet :py:attr:`~pyglet.Options.dpi_scaling` option supports multiple
scaling modes.

Each has pros and cons for different platforms and hardware. For example,
the default ``"real"`` mode matches the window, rendering, and input to a
computer display's "real" physical pixels.

On a HiDPI screen, this could mean:

* projects with the right art styles can look crisply detailed
* other projects may look tiny or poorly-scaled

In the latter case, other scaling modes may help. You will need to
experiment to find the best one(s) for your specific needs. Please
see the following to get started:

* :py:attr:`pyglet.options.dpi_scaling <pyglet.Options.dpi_scaling>`
* :py:attr:`pyglet.Options`
* :py:attr:`Window.dpi <pyglet.window.Window.dpi>`
* :py:attr:`Window.scale <pyglet.window.Window.scale>`

Labels & Text Layouts
---------------------

Argument Consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The positional arguments for creating :py:class:`pyglet.text` layouts
and labels now all *start* with similar argument orders. This helps
you:

* switch between labels and layouts
* create custom subclasses

The order *after* the initial arguments may differ. Please see any
relevant API documentation to learn more.

Layout Arguments
""""""""""""""""
All :py:mod:`pyglet.text.layout` types now *start* with the same positional
argument order::

    TextLayout(document, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)
    ScrollableTextLayout(document, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)
    IncrementalTextLayout(document, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)

These types all take a concrete instance of an
:py:class:`~pyglet.text.layout.AbstractDocument` subclass as their
first argument. Subsequent arguments may differ.

Please see the following to learn more:

* :py:class:`pyglet.text.layout.TextLayout`
* :py:class:`pyglet.text.layout.ScrollableTextLayout`
* :py:class:`pyglet.text.layout.IncrementalTextLayout`

Label Arguments
"""""""""""""""
The label classes now also share similar early argument orders.

Only :py:class:`~pyglet.text.DocumentLabel` is identical to layouts in
its initial arguments. The others both take a string ``text`` argument
as their first argument::

    DocumentLabel(document, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)
    Label(text, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)
    HTMLLabel(text, x, y, z, width, height, anchor_x, anchor_y, rotation, ...)

As with layouts, the subsequent arguments may vary. Please see the following
to learn more:

* :py:class:`pyglet.text.DocumentLabel`
* :py:class:`pyglet.text.Label`
* :py:class:`pyglet.text.HTMLLabel`


Replace Bold With Weight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The string ``weight`` argument is more flexible than the ``bold`` argument it replaces.

.. note:: This does not apply to :py:class:`~pyglet.text.HTMLLabel`.

For :py:class:`pyglet.text.Label` and :py:class:`pyglet.text.DocumentLabel`,
their ``weight`` argument now allows choosing a desired font weight. This assumes
your specific font and weight combination is:

#. Loaded
#. Supported by the font
#. Supported by the rendering back-end

For known cross-platform ``weight`` strings, please see :py:class:`pyglet.text.Weight`.

* Constant names and values mimic OpenType and CSS (``"bold"``, ``"thin"``, ``"extrabold"``, etc)
* Some rendering back-ends *may* support additional weight string values

Shapes
------
For consistency with the rest of the library, it was decided to represent
all angles in degrees instead of radians. Previously we had a mix of both,
which lead to some confusion. Using degrees also makes the API consistent
with Sprites and other rotatable objects, which have long used degrees.

The arguments for :py:class:`~pyglet.shapes.Line` have changed slightly.
Instead of "width", we now use "thickness". This matches with other shapes
that are made up of line segments. For example the :py:class:`~pyglet.shapes.Box`
shape, which already uses "width" (and height) to mean it's overall size.
Going forward, any shape that is made up of lines should use `thickness`
for the thickness/width of those lines.

.. _migration-controllers:

Controllers
-----------

Events from analog sticks and directional pads (d-pads) now pass
:py:class:`~pyglet.math.Vec2` instances to handler functions.

Vectors offer helper methods in addition to common math operators (`+`, `-`, `*`,
etc). Since this makes many tasks easier, we'll cover the most common ones below.


Handling Diagonals with the D-Pad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:py:class:`Vec2.normalize() <pyglet.math.Vec2.normalize>` makes it easy to
handle diagonal movement:

.. code-block:: python

    # In pyglet 2.1, this handles diagonals
    @controller.event
    def on_dpad_motion(controller, vector):
        # Multiplying a vector by an integer or float multiplies all components
        player_position += vector.normalize() * PLAYER_SPEED

Without vectors, pre-2.1 code was more verbose:

.. code-block:: python

    @controller.event
    def on_dpad_motion(controller, dpleft, dpright, dpup, dpdown):
        if dpleft:
            # move left
        if dpright:
            # move right
        if dpright and dpdown:
            # move diagonally, but you have to normalize the values by yourself


Getting D-Pad Booleans
""""""""""""""""""""""
If you need boolean data, you can quickly convert from a :py:class:`~pyglet.math.Vec2`
like this::

    dpleft, dpright, dpup, dpdown = vector.x < 0, vector.x > 0, vector.y > 0, vector.y < 0

Handling Analog Stick Drift
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Analog sticks can "drift" when near zero, but vectors can help.

Circular Dead Zones
"""""""""""""""""""
The simplest approach to drift is a circular "dead zone" which ignores input
with a :py:meth:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.length` beneath a certain threshold::

    @controller.event
    def on_stick_motion(controller, name, vector):
        if vector.length() <= DEADZONE_RADIUS:
            return
        elif name == "leftstick":
            # Do something with the 2D vector
        elif name == "rightstick":
            # Do something with the 2D vector

Non-Circular Sticks
"""""""""""""""""""
:py:meth:`Vec2.normalize <pyglet.math.Vec2.normalize` can also help when
an unusual analog stick input could exceed ``1.0`` in length.

For example, a :py:class:`~pyglet.input.Controller` for a device with a non-circular
input range could return a value with a combined :py:meth:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.length`
greater than ``1.0``. Normalizating allows concisely clamping the input to ``1.0``::

            # Avoid a "cheating" / bugged controller for movement
            vector = min(vector, vector.normalize())
            player.position += vector * PLAYER_SPEED


Accesing Vector Components
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
You can directly access  individual :py:attr:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.x` and
:py:attr:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.y` attributes or unpack a vector:

.. code-block:: python

   # Direct access
   x = vector2.x
   y = vector2.y

   # Unpacking-style access
   x, y = vector2

Please see the following to learn more about vectors in pyglet 2.1:

* :py:class:`pyglet.math.Vec2`

Gui
---

Widget Event Dispatching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All widget events now dispatch the widget instance itself as the first argument.

This is similar to how Controller/Joystick events are implemented. It allows
you to re-use a single handler functions across multiple widgets without "forgetting"
which widget dispatched an event.

Button Argument Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :py:class:`~pyglet.gui.widgets.ToggleButton` and :py:class:`~pyglet.gui.widgets.PushButton`
widgets now use ``pressed`` and ``unpressed`` for their image arguments.

.. _migration-math:

Math
----
The :py:mod:`~pyglet.math` module includes a number of performance and
usability changes.

Immutable Vectors and Matrices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All :py:mod:`~pyglet.math` datatypes are now :py:class:`typing.NamedTuple`
subclasses. This provides multiple benefits:

* More consistent creation syntax
* Vectors and matrices are now hashable

  * They can be :py:class:`dict` keys or :py:class:`set` members
  * Combine with ``/``, ``//``, :py:func:`round` or :py:func:`math.floor` for easy spatial hashing

* Cleaner controller code (see :ref:`migration-controllers`)

.. important:: The mypy typechecker is incompatible with :py:mod:`pyglet.math`.

               When typechecking, it is a good idea to:

               1. exclude :py:mod:`pyglet.math` from mypy checks
               2. use pyright instead (pylance in VS Code)

Vector Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syntax for the Vec types has changed in several ways.
Some of these changes are due to becoming :py:class:`typing.NamedTuple` subclasses, while others
were done for general usibility. Where possible, we adopt the behavor of GLM/GLSL for most operations,
for a more familar experience for computer graphics programmers.

* The arguments for ``Vec2.from_polar`` have been reversed for consistency. The ``length`` argument also now defaults
  to 1.0. This will fail silently, so take care to correct this if you are using this method in your code::

    Vec2.from_polar(angle: 'float', length: 'float' = 1.0)

* Vector length is now obtained from the new :py:meth:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.length` method. Previously ``len`` or ``abs``
  could be used, but this is no longer the case. The ``len`` function will now give you the number of items in the
  vector (ie: 2, 3, or 4), not the vector length. The ``abs`` function will give you a new vector with absolute values::

    >>> vec = Vec2(1, 9)
    >>> vec.length()
    9.055385138137417
    >>> len(vec)
    2
    >>>
    >>> vec = Vec2(-10, 5)
    >>> abs(vec)
    Vec2(x=10, y=5)

* The vector ``heading`` property has been replace with the :py:meth:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.heading` function. This is to
  better indicate that this is a calculation, not a static attribute. The function call is also margincally faster::

* The ``mag`` property has been removed. The :py:meth:`~pyglet.math.Vec2.length` function should be used in it's place.

* The ``Vec2.from_magnitude`` function has been removed. For creating a new vector of a certain magnitude, you can
  simply multiply a normalized vector by the desired length. For example::

    >>> vec = Vec2(1, 9)
    >>> vec.normalize()
    Vec2(x=0.11043152607484653, y=0.9938837346736188)
    >>> vec.normalize() * 2
    Vec2(x=0.22086305214969307, y=1.9877674693472376)


Matrix Creation Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:py:class:`~pyglet.math.Mat3` and :py:mod:`pyglet.math.Mat4` now accept arguments
directly instead of an iterable.

If you create your matrices via the helper methods, nothing changes. If you
create matrices directly, pyglet 2.1 allows more efficient code:

.. code-block:: python

    # pyglet 2.1 requires passing the elements directly
    my_mat4 = pyglet.math.Mat4(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)

    # pyglet 2.0 required an intermediate iterable like a list
    my_mat4 = pyglet.math.Mat4([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...])

If your pre-existing code has an ``intermediate_iterable``, you can use
``*`` unpacking as a quick fix:

.. code-block:: python

    # Use * unpacking to unpack the pre-allocated intermediate_iterable
    my_mat4 = pyglet.math.Mat4(*intermediate_iterable)


Models
------
The :py:mod:`~pyglet.model` module has seen some changes. This is an undocumented
WIP module for pyglet 2.0, and it remains so pyglet 2.1. That said, it's in a more
usable state now. The first change is that :py:meth:`~pyglet.model.load` now returns
a ``Scene`` object instead of a ``Model`` object. The Scene is a new, "pure data"
intermediate representation of a 3D scene, that closely mimics the layout of the glTF
format. The :py:meth:`~pyglet.model.Scene.create_models` method can be used to create
``Model`` instances from the Scene, but the Scene data can also be manually iterated
over for more advanced use cases.

Canvas module
-------------
The ``pyglet.canvas`` module has been renamed to ``pyglet.display``. The "canvas"
concept was a work-in-progress in legacy pyglet, and was never fully fleshed out.
It appears to have been meant to allow arbitrary renderable areas, but this type
of functionality can now be easily accomplished with Framebuffers. The name ``display``
is a more accurate representation of what the code in the module actually relates to.
The usage is the same, with just the name change::

    my_display = pyglet.canvas.get_display()     # old pyglet 2.0
    my_display = pyglet.display.get_display()    # new pyglet 2.1
