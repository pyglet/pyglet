Installation
============

.. note:: These instructions apply to pyglet |version|.

pyglet is a pure python library, so no special steps are required for
installation. You can install it in a variety of ways, or simply copy the
`pyglet` folder directly into your project. If you're unsure what to do,
the recommended method is to install it into your local ``site-packages``
directory. pyglet is available `on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyglet>`_.
and can be installed like any other Python library via **pip**:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install pyglet --user

You can also clone the repository using **git** and install from source:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet.git
    cd pyglet
    python setup.py install --user


To play compressed audio and video files (anything except for WAV), you will need
`FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_.


Running the examples
--------------------

The source code archives include examples. Archives are
`available on Github <https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/releases/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    unzip pyglet-x.x.x.zip
    cd pyglet-x.x.x
    python examples/hello_world.py


As mentioned above, you can also clone the repository using Git:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet.git
    cd pyglet
    python examples/hello_world.py
