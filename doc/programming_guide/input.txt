Working with other input devices
================================

Pyglet's `input` module allows you to accept input from any USB human
interface device (HID).  High level interfaces are provided for
working with joysticks and with the Apple Remote.

Using joysticks
---------------

Before using a joystick, you must find it and open it.  To get a list
of all joystick devices currently connected to your computer, call 
`pyglet.input.get_joysticks`::

    joysticks = pyglet.input.get_joysticks()

Then choose a joystick from the list and call `Joystick.open` to open
the device::

    if joysticks:
        joystick = joysticks[0]
    joystick.open()

You may immediately begin querying the state of the joystick by
looking at its attributes.  The current position of the joystick is
recorded in its 'x' and 'y' attributes, both of which are normalized
to values within the range of -1 to 1.  For the x-axis, `x` = -1 means
the joystick is pushed all the way to the left and `x` = 1 means the
joystick is pushed to the right.  For the y-axis, a value of `y` = -1
means that the joystick is pushed up and a value of `y` = 1 means that
the joystick is pushed down.

If your joystick has two analog controllers, the position of the
second controller is typically given by `z` and `rz`, where `z` is the
horizontal axis position and `rz` is the vertical axis position.

The state of the joystick buttons is contained in the `buttons`
attribute as a list of boolean values.  A True value indicates that
the corresponding button is being pressed.  While buttons may be
labeled A, B, X, or Y on the physical joystick, they are simply
referred to by their index when accessing the `buttons` list.  There
is no way to know which button index corresponds to which physical
button on the device without simply testing the particular joystick.
So it is a good idea to let users change button assignments.

Each open joystick dispatches events when the joystick changes state.
For buttons, there is the `on_joybutton_press` event which is sent
whenever any of the joystick's buttons are pressed::

    def on_joybutton_press(joystick, button):
        pass

and the `on_joybutton_release` event which is sent whenever any of the
joystick's buttons are released::
 
    def on_joybutton_release(joystick, button):
        pass

The `joystick` parameter is the `Joystick` instance whose buttons
changed state (useful if you have multiple joysticks connected).
The `button` parameter signifies which button changed and is simply an
integer value, the index of the corresponding button in the `buttons`
list. 

For most games, it is probably best to examine the current position of
the joystick directly by using the `x` and `y` attributes.  However if
you want to receive notifications whenever these values change you
should handle the `on_joyaxis_motion event`::

    def on_joyaxis_motion(joystick, axis, value):
        pass

The `joystick` parameter again tells you which joystick device
changed.  The `axis` parameter is string such as "x", "y", or "rx"
telling you which axis changed value.  And `value` gives the current
normalized value of the axis, ranging between -1 and 1.

If the joystick has a hat switch, you may examine its current value by
looking at the `hat_x` and `hat_y` attributes.  For both, the values
are either -1, 0, or 1.  Note that `hat_y` will output 1 in the up
position and -1 in the down position, which is the opposite of the
y-axis control.

To be notified when the hat switch changes value, handle the
`on_joyhat_motion` event::

    def on_joyhat_motion(joystick, hat_x, hat_y):
        pass

The `hat_x` and `hat_y` parameters give the same values as the
joystick's `hat_x` and `hat_y` attributes.

A good way to use the joystick event handlers might be to define them
within a controller class and then call::

    joystick.push_handlers(my_controller)


Using the Apple Remote
----------------------

The Apple Remote is a small infrared remote originally distributed
with the iMac.  The remote has six buttons, which are accessed with
the names `left, `right`, `up`, `down`, `menu`, and `select`.
Additionally when certain buttons are held down, they act as virtual
buttons.  These are named `left_hold', 'right_hold', 'menu_hold', and
'select_hold'.

To use the remote, first call `get_apple_remote`::

    remote = pyglet.input.get_apple_remote()

Then open it::

    if remote:
        remote.open(window, exclusive=True)

The remote is opened in exclusive mode so that while we are using the
remote in our program, pressing the buttons does not activate Front
Row, or change the volume, etc. on the computer.

The following event handlers tell you when a button on the remote has
been either pressed or released::

    def on_button_press(button):
        pass

    def on_button_release(button):
        pass

The `button` parameter indicates which button changed and is a string
equal to one of the ten button names defined above: "up", "down",
"left", "left_hold", "right",  "right_hold", "select", "select_hold",
"menu", or "menu_hold". 

To use the remote, you may define code for the event handlers in
some controller class and then call::

    remote.push_handlers(my_controller)
