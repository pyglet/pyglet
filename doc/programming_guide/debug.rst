Debugging tools
===============

pyglet includes a number of debug paths that can be enabled during or before
application startup.  These were primarily developed to aid in debugging
pyglet itself, however some of them may also prove useful for understanding
and debugging pyglet applications.

Each debug option is a key in the :py:attr:`pyglet.options` dictionary.
Options can be set directly on the dictionary before any other modules
are imported::

    import pyglet
    pyglet.options['debug_api'] = False

They can also be set with environment variables before pyglet is imported.
The corresponding environment variable for each option is the string
``PYGLET_`` prefixed to the uppercase option key.  For example, the
environment variable for ``debug_api`` is ``PYGLET_DEBUG_API``.  Boolean options
are set or unset with ``1`` and ``0`` values.

A summary of the debug environment variables appears in the table below.

          - bool


The ``debug_media`` and ``debug_font`` options are used to debug the
:py:mod:`pyglet.media` and :py:mod:`pyglet.font` modules, respectively.
Their behaviour is platform-dependent and useful only for pyglet developers.

The remaining debug options are detailed below.

Debugging OpenGL
----------------

The ``debug_graphics_batch`` option causes all
:py:class:`~pyglet.graphics.Batch` objects to dump their
rendering tree to standard output before drawing, after any change (so two
drawings of the same tree will only dump once).  This is useful to debug
applications making use of :py:class:`~pyglet.graphics.Group` and
:py:class:`~pyglet.graphics.Batch` rendering.

Error checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``debug_api`` option intercepts most OpenGL calls and calls ``glGetError``
afterwards (it only does this where such a call would be legal).  If an error
is reported, an exception is raised immediately.

This option is enabled by default unless the ``-O`` flag (optimisation) is
given to Python, or the script is running from within a py2exe or py2app
package.

Tracing
^^^^^^^

The ``debug_api_trace`` option causes all OpenGL functions called to be dumped
to standard out.  When combined with ``debug_api_trace_args``, the arguments
given to each function are also printed (they are abbreviated if necessary to
avoid dumping large amounts of buffer data).

Tracing execution
-----------------

The ``debug_trace`` option enables Python-wide function tracing.  This causes
every function call to be printed to standard out.  Due to the large number of
function calls required just to initialise pyglet, it is recommended to
redirect standard output to a file when using this option.

The ``debug_trace_args`` option additionally prints the arguments to each
function call.

When ``debug_trace_depth`` is greater than 1 the caller(s) of each function
(and their arguments, if ``debug_trace_args`` is set) are also printed.  Each
caller is indented beneath the callee.  The default depth is 1, specifying
that no callers are printed.

Platform-specific debugging
---------------------------

The ``debug_lib`` option causes the path of each loaded library to be printed
to standard out.  This is performed by the undocumented ``pyglet.lib`` module,
which on Linux and Mac OS X must sometimes follow complex procedures to find
the correct library.  On Windows not all libraries are loaded via this module,
so they will not be printed (however, loading Windows DLLs is sufficiently
simple that there is little need for this information).

Linux
^^^^^

X11 errors are caught by pyglet and suppressed, as there are plenty of X
servers in the wild that generate errors that can be safely ignored.
The ``debug_x11`` option causes these errors to be dumped to standard out,
along with a traceback of the Python stack (this may or may not correspond to
the error, depending on whether or not it was reported asynchronously).

Windows
^^^^^^^

The ``debug_win32`` option causes all library calls into ``user32.dll``,
``kernel32.dll`` and ``gdi32.dll`` to be intercepted.  Before each library
call ``SetLastError(0)`` is called, and afterwards ``GetLastError()`` is
called.  Any errors discovered are written to a file named
``debug_win32.log``.  Note that an error is only valid if the function called
returned an error code, but the interception function does not check this.
