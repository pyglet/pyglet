The pyglet event framework
==========================

The `pyglet.window`, `pyglet.media`, `pyglet.app` and `pyglet.text` modules
make use of a consistent event pattern, which provides several ways to attach
event handlers to objects.  You can also reuse this pattern in your own
classes easily.

Throughout this documentation, an "event dispatcher" is an object that has
events it needs to notify other objects about, and an "event handler" is some
code that can be attached to a dispatcher.:

Setting event handlers
----------------------

An event handler is simply a function with a formal parameter list
corresponding to the event type.  For example, the `Window.on_resize` event
has the parameters ``(width, height)``, so an event handler for this event
could be::

    def on_resize(width, height):
        pass

The `Window` class subclasses `EventDispatcher`, which enables it to have
event handlers attached to it.  The simplest way to attach an event handler is
to set the corresponding attribute on the object::

    window = pyglet.window.Window()

    def on_resize(width, height):
        pass
    window.on_resize = on_resize

While this technique is straight-forward, it requires you to write the name of
the event three times for the one function, which can get tiresome.  pyglet
provides a shortcut using the `event` decorator::

    window = window.Window()

    @window.event
    def on_resize(width, height):
        pass

This is not entirely equivalent to setting the event handler directly on the
object.  If the object already had an event handler, using ``@event`` will add
the handler to the object, rather than replacing it.  The next section
describes this functionality in detail.

As shown in `Subclassing Window`, you can also attach event handlers by
subclassing the event dispatcher and adding the event handler as a method::

    class MyWindow(pyglet.window.Window):
        def on_resize(self, width, height):
            pass

Stacking event handlers
-----------------------

It is often convenient to attach more than one event handler for an event.
`EventDispatcher` allows you to stack event handlers upon one another, rather
than replacing them outright.  The event will propogate from the top of the
stack to the bottom, but can be stopped by any handler along the way.

To push an event handler onto the stack, use the `push_handlers` method::

    def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
        if symbol == key.SPACE
            fire_laser()

    window.push_handlers(on_key_press)

As a convenience, the ``@event`` decorator can be used as an alternative to
`push_handlers`::

    @window.event
    def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
        if symbol == key.SPACE
            fire_laser()

One use for pushing handlers instead of setting them is to handle different
parameterisations of events in different functions.  In the above example, if
the spacebar is pressed, the laser will be fired.  After the event handler
returns control is passed to the next handler on the stack, which on a
`Window` is a function that checks for the ESC key and sets the ``has_exit``
attribute if it is pressed.  By pushing the event handler instead of setting
it, the application keeps the default behaviour while adding additional
functionality.

You can prevent the remaining event handlers in the stack from receiving the
event by returning a true value.  The following event handler, when pushed
onto the window, will prevent the escape key from exiting the program::

    def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
        if symbol == key.ESCAPE:
            return True

    window.push_handlers(on_key_press)

You can push more than one event handler at a time, which is especially useful
when coupled with the ``pop_handlers`` function.  In the following example,
when the game starts some additional event handlers are pushed onto the stack.
When the game ends (perhaps returning to some menu screen) the handlers are
popped off in one go::

    def start_game():
        def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
            print 'Key pressed in game'
            return True

        def on_mouse_press(x, y, button, modifiers):
            print 'Mouse button pressed in game'
            return True

        window.push_handlers(on_key_press, on_mouse_press)

    def end_game():
        window.pop_handlers()

Note that you do not specify which handlers to pop off the stack -- the entire
top "level" (consisting of all handlers specified in a single call to
`push_handlers`) is popped.

You can apply the same pattern in an object-oriented fashion by grouping
related event handlers in a single class.  In the following example, a
``GameEventHandler`` class is defined.  An instance of that class can be
pushed on and popped off of a window::

    class GameEventHandler(object):
        def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers):
            print 'Key pressed in game'
            return True

        def on_mouse_press(self, x, y, button, modifiers):
            print 'Mouse button pressed in game'
            return True

    game_handlers = GameEventHandler()

    def start_game()
        window.push_handlers(game_handlers)
    
    def stop_game()
        window.pop_handlers()

Creating your own event dispatcher
----------------------------------

pyglet provides only the `Window` and `Player` event dispatchers, but
exposes a public interface for creating and dispatching your own events.

The steps for creating an event dispatcher are:

1. Subclass `EventDispatcher`
2. Call the `register_event_type` class method on your subclass for each
   event your subclass will recognise.
3. Call `dispatch_event` to create and dispatch an event as needed.

In the following example, a hypothetical GUI widget provides several events::

    class ClankingWidget(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        def clank(self):
            self.dispatch_event('on_clank')

        def click(self, clicks):
            self.dispatch_event('on_clicked', clicks)

        def on_clank(self):
            print 'Default clank handler.'

    ClankingWidget.register_event_type('on_clank')
    ClankingWidget.register_event_type('on_clicked')
    
Event handlers can then be attached as described in the preceding sections::

    widget = ClankingWidget()
    
    @widget.event
    def on_clank():
        pass

    @widget.event
    def on_clicked(clicks):
        pass

    def override_on_clicked(clicks):
        pass
    
    widget.push_handlers(on_clicked=override_on_clicked)

The `EventDispatcher` takes care of propogating the event to all attached
handlers or ignoring it if there are no handlers for that event.

There is zero instance overhead on objects that have no event handlers
attached (the event stack is created only when required).  This makes
`EventDispatcher` suitable for use even on light-weight objects that may not
always have handlers.  For example, `Player` is an `EventDispatcher`
even though potentially hundreds of these objects may be created and destroyed
each second, and most will not need an event handler.

Implementing the Observer pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Observer design pattern`_, also known as Publisher/Subscriber, is a
simple way to decouple software components.  It is used extensively in many
large software projects; for example, Java's AWT and Swing GUI toolkits and the
Python ``logging`` module; and is fundamental to any Model-View-Controller
architecture.

`EventDispatcher` can be used to easily add observerable components to your
application.  The following example recreates the `ClockTimer` example from
`Design Patterns` (pages 300-301), though without needing the bulky
``Attach``, ``Detach`` and ``Notify`` methods::

    # The subject
    class ClockTimer(pyglet.event.EventDispatcher):
        def tick(self):
            self.dispatch_event('on_update')
    ClockTimer.register_event_type('on_update')

    # Abstract observer class
    class Observer(object):
        def __init__(self, subject):
            subject.push_handlers(self)

    # Concrete observer
    class DigitalClock(Observer):
        def on_update(self):
            pass

    # Concrete observer
    class AnalogClock(Observer):
        def on_update(self):
            pass

    timer = ClockTimer()
    digital_clock = DigitalClock(timer)
    analog_clock = AnalogClock(timer)

The two clock objects will be notified whenever the timer is "ticked", though
neither the timer nor the clocks needed prior knowledge of the other.  During
object construction any relationships between subjects and observers can be
created.

Documenting events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyglet uses a modified version of `Epydoc`_ to construct its API
documentation.  One of these modifications is the inclusion of an "Events"
summary for event dispatchers.  If you plan on releasing your code as a
library for others to use, you may want to consider using the same tool to
document code.

The patched version of Epydoc is included in the pyglet repository under
``trunk/tools/epydoc`` (it is not included in distributions).  It has
special notation for document event methods, and allows conditional
execution when introspecting source code.

If the ``sys.is_epydoc`` attribute exists and is ``True``, the module is
currently being introspected for documentation.  pyglet places event
documentation only within this conditional, to prevent extraneous methods
appearing on the class.

To document an event, create a method with the event's signature and add a
blank ``event`` field to the docstring::

    import sys

    class MyDispatcher(object):
        if getattr(sys, 'is_epydoc'):
            def on_update():
                '''The object was updated.

                :event:
                '''

Note that the event parameters should not include ``self``.  The function will
appear in the "Events" table and not as a method.
