Images
======

pyglet can load many types of images, such as PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP and DDS.
More image types can be loaded, depending on the operating system and any
optional modules installed (see `Image decoders and encoders`_, below).  Once
loaded, images can be efficiently displayed or used with other pyglet
modules for more sophisticated effects.

pyglet can also save images; typically this is used for saving "screenshots"
of a window, but can also be used as a handy image format conversion utility.

Other pyglet packages rely on images; for example, `pyglet.ext.scene2d` and
`pyglet.ext.layout`.  They will typically require an instance of
`AbstractImage`.  This chapter will describe how to work with these images,
but does not cover any specific functionality provided by modules outside of
`pyglet.image`.

Loading an image
----------------

Quite possibly the only function you need to know is how to load an image::

    from pyglet import image
    kitten = image.load('kitten.png')

Without any additional arguments, `load` will attempt to load the
filename specified using any available image decoder.  This will allow you to
load PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP and DDS files, and possibly other files as well,
depending on your operating system and additional installed modules.  If the
image cannot be loaded, an `ImageDecodeException` will be raised.

You can load an image from any file-like object by specifying the `file`
keyword parameter::

    kitten_stream = open('kitten.png', 'rb')
    kitten = image.load('kitten.png', file=kitten_stream)

In this case the filename ``kitten.png`` is optional, but gives a hint to the
decoder as to the file type (it is otherwise unused).

Working with images
-------------------

The image returned will implement the `AbstractImage` class.  You cannot make
any assumptions about the particular class instance that will be returned, as
this depends on the decoder used.  All images support the attributes:

`width`
    The width of the image, in pixels.
`height`
    The height of the image, in pixels.

You may only want to use a portion of the complete image.  You can use the
`get_region` method to return an image of a rectangular region of a source
image::

    image_part = kitten.get_region(x=10, y=10, width=100, height=100)

This returns an image with dimensions 100x100.  The region extracted from
`image` is aligned such that the bottom-left corner of the rectangle is 10
pixels from the left and 10 pixels from the bottom of the image.

Image regions can be used as if they were complete images.  Note that changes
to an image region may or may not be reflected on the source image, and
changes to the source image may or may not be reflected on any region images.
You should not assume either behaviour.

Displaying images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `blit` method to draw an image to the current window::

    kitten.blit(x, y, z)

The `x`, `y` and `z` coordinates locate where to draw the  bottom-left corner
of the image.  With the projection defined above (or the one used by
`pyglet.sprite`), the Y dimension is 0 at the bottom of the window and
increases upwards, and the Z dimension is unused.

You can use the `blit` method to draw any image, including an image region.

Saving an image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any image can be saved using the `save` method::

    kitten.save('kitten.jpg')

or, specifying a file-like object::

    kitten_stream = open('kitten.jpg', 'wb')
    kitten.save('kitten.jpg', file=kitten_stream)

Module details
--------------

As mentioned above, images all implement the `AbstractImage` class.  The
class hierarchy of this interface is shown below.

.. image:: image_classes.svg

For the simple uses described in the previous section, it is enough to use
only the `AbstractImage` interface; for example, for loading, saving and
blitting images.

Accessing pixel data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `ImageData` class represents an image as a string or sequence of pixel
data, or as a ctypes pointer.  Details such as the pitch and component layout
are also stored in the class.  

Most image decoders return an instance of `ImageData` when an image is loaded.
You can also create an `ImageData` instance for any type of `AbstractImage` by
accessing the `AbstractImage.image_data` property.  For example::

    kitten = image.load('kitten.jpg')
    # image is probably an `ImageData`, but there is no guarantee
    kitten = kitten.image_data
    # now image is definitely `ImageData`.

There is no performance penalty for accessing `image_data` of an `ImageData`,
however accessing it for a `Texture` (see next section) can be quite
time-consuming.

The design of `ImageData` is to allow applications to access the detail in the
format they prefer, rather than having to understand the many formats that
each operating system and OpenGL make use of.

The `pitch` and `format` properties determine how the bytes are arranged.
`pitch` gives the number of bytes between each consecutive row.  The data is
assumed to run from left-to-right, bottom-to-top, unless `pitch` is negative,
in which case it runs from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  There is no need for
rows to be tightly packed; larger `pitch` values are often used to align each
row to machine word boundaries.

The `format` property gives the number and order of color components.  It is a
string of one or more of the letters corresponding to the components in the
following table:

    = ============
    R Red
    G Green
    B Blue
    A Alpha
    L Luminance
    I Intensity
    = ============

For example, a format string of ``"RGBA"`` corrensponds to four bytes of
colour data, in the order red, green, blue, alpha.  Note that machine
endianness has no impact on the interpretation of a format string.

The length of a format string always gives the number of bytes per pixel.  So,
the minimum absolute pitch for a given image is ``len(kitten.format) *
kitten.width``.   

To retrieve pixel data in a particular format, set the `pitch` and `format`
properties then read `data`.  The following example reads tightly packed rows
in ``RGB`` format (the alpha component, if any, will be discarded)::

    kitten = kitten.image_data
    kitten.format = 'RGB'
    kitten.pitch = len(kitten.format) * kitten.width
    data = kitten.data

`data` always returns a string, however it can be set to a ctypes array,
stdlib array, list of byte data, string, or ctypes pointer.  Remember to 
set the format and pitch of the data `before` setting it on the instance.

The `CompressedImageData` class is unrelated to `ImageData`; it stores image
data in one of the OpenGL compressed texture formats such as S3TC.  There
currently no software conversion implemented to access the pixel data of these
images (however, you can convert `CompressedImageData` to a `Texture` and then
back into an `ImageData`).

OpenGL imaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section assumes you are familiar with texture mapping in OpenGL (for
example, chapter 9 of the `OpenGL Programming Guide`_).

To create a texture from any `AbstractImage`, access its `texture` property::

    kitten = image.load('kitten.jpg')
    texture = kitten.texture

Textures are automatically created and used by `ImageData` when blitted.  It
is useful to use textures directly when aiming for high performance or 3D
applications.

The `Texture` class represents any texture object.  The `target` attribute
gives the texture target (for example, ``GL_TEXTURE_2D``) and `id` the texture
name.  For example, to bind a texture::

    glBindTexture(texture.target, texture.id)

Implementations of OpenGL prior to 2.0 require textures to have dimensions
that are powers of two (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).  Because of this restriction,
pyglet will always create textures of these dimensions (there are several
non-conformant post-2.0 implementations).  This could have unexpected results
for a user blitting a texture loaded from a file of non-standard dimensions.
To remedy this, pyglet returns a `TextureRegion` of the larger texture
corresponding to just the part of the texture covered by the original image.

A `TextureRegion` has an `owner` attribute that references the larger texture.
The following session demonstrates this::

    >>> rgba = image.load('tests/image/rgba.png')
    >>> rgba
    <ImageData 235x257>         # The image is 235x257
    >>> rgba.texture
    <TextureRegion 235x257>     # The returned texture is a region
    >>> rgba.texture.owner
    <Texture 256x512>           # The owning texture has power-2 dimensions
    >>> 

A `TextureRegion` defines a `tex_coords` attribute that gives the texture
coordinates to use for a quad mapping the whole image.  `tex_coords` is a
4-tuple of 3-tuple of floats; i.e., each texture coordinate is given in 3
dimensions.  The following code can be used to render a quad for a texture
region::

    texture = kitten.texture
    t = texture.tex_coords
    w, h = texture.width, texture.height
    array = (GLfloat * 32)(
         t[0][0], t[0][1], t[0][2], 1.,
         x,       y,       z,       1.,
         t[1][0], t[1][1], t[1][2], 1., 
         x + w,   y,       z,       1.,
         t[2][0], t[2][1], t[2][2], 1., 
         x + w,   y + h,   z,       1.,
         t[3][0], t[3][1], t[3][2], 1., 
         x,       y + h,   z,       1.)

    glPushClientAttrib(GL_CLIENT_VERTEX_ARRAY_BIT)
    glInterleavedArrays(GL_T4F_V4F, 0, array)
    glDrawArrays(GL_QUADS, 0, 4)
    glPopClientAttrib()

The `Texture.blit` method does this.

Drawing to images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `blit_into` method can be used to create composite images.  For example,
to blit an image of a sheep onto an image of some grass::

    grass = image.load('grass.png').texture
    sheep = image.load('sheep.png')
    grass.blit_into(sheep, x, y, z)

The `z` parameter is ignored except for `Texture3D` (described in `Image
sequences`_).  `x` and `y` locate the lower-left corner of the source image
within the destination image.  The Y dimension increases upwards.

There are several restrictions on the use of `blit_into`:

* The destination image cannot be an `ImageData` or `CompressedImageData`
* If the destination image is a texture, the source cannot be a texture.
