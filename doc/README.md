# Building the documentation

## Basic

Install doc requirements:

    pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

The simplest way build html docs is with the `make.py` script:

    python setup.py build_sphinx

The build result will appear in a `_build` directory in the root of the project.

## Advanced

The more advanced way to building docs is using `make`
(`make.bat` for windows).

    cd doc/
    make html

The HTML docs will be generated in the `doc/_build` subdirectory.

Please run `make help` for a complete list of targets, but be aware that some
of them may have extra requirements.

    $ make help
