content:

*pyglet* is a powerful, yet easy to use Python library for developing games and other visually-rich applications on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It supports windowing, user interface event handling, Joysticks, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music. All of this with a friendly Pythonic API, that's simple to learn and doesn't get in your way. 

pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license, allowing you to use it for both commercial and other open-source projects with very little restriction.

No external dependencies or installation requirements. For most application and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python, simplifying distribution and installation. It's easy to package your project with freezers such as PyInstaller.

title: Flexible native windowing
-----
description:

pyglet provides real platform native windows, allowing you to take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops. Fully aware of multi-monitor setups, you have control over how your application or game is displayed. Create multiple floating windows, or single  windows with control over which monitor they appear on, full screen or windowed.

title: Built-in support for images and audio
-----
description:

pyglet contains built-in support for standard formats such as wav, png, bmp, and others. If that's not enough, pyglet can optionally use FFmpeg to play back audio formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and WMA, and video formats such as MPEG-2, H.264, WMV, and anything else that FFmpeg supports.

##### service #####
title: Written in pure Python
-----
description: pyglet is written entirely in pure Python, and makes use of the ctypes module to interface with system libraries. You can modify the codebase or make a contribution without any second language compilation steps or compiler setup. Despite being pure Python, pyglet has excellent performance thanks to advanced batching allowing for drawing thousands of sprites or animations.
