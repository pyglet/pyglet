pyglet website
==============

The pyglet website is a simple static site made with the Lektor CMS.
Lektor can be installed via pip: `pip install lektor --user`
To edit the site, run `lektor server` from the website directory. 
Please see the documentation at https://getlektor.org for more information. 

Alternatively, you can edit static *.lr files directly.
