	description:
	Fix bug in OpenAL
	
( https://bitbucket.org/dangillet/pyglet )


Goals

 - better capture of debugging info
	More player state captured, less perturbation in timings by capturing raw info and save after play

- support postprocessing of debugging info into different views / reports
    Player state captured can be postprocessed in a variety of reports; easy to define new reports.
	Reports can be rendered for raw data captured in another machine.

- have some quality measure to programmatically compare two test runs and tell which is better
    Rought sketch ATM, qtty of anomalies over all samples in the debugging session.
	Useful to tell if a change in code or library gives better or worse results.

- enforce an ordered schema to store test results
	Avoids mixing results obtained under different settings.
	Consistent access to debug data captured by different persons or under different conditions.

See readme_run_test.txt for the instructions a tester or user will need to follow to send debug info.

See the manual.txt initial sections for dev workflows and basic descriptions.
