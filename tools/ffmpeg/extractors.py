class OverallDefectsCounter:
    """Helper class to count defects over a range of media player sample plays

    Collaborates with a caller, which determines which samples to process and
    which samples to skip.

    The main result is a dict of defect: count over all suitable samples

    Additionally, classifies the samples in the disjoint sets:
        crashed_samples: samples that crashed
        no_dbg_samples: samples with no media_player state recording
        skipped_samples: samples that the caller excludes from the overall counts
        perfect_play_samples: non-skipped samples that played perfectly
        counters_non_perfect_play_samples: A dict of
            sample: <counters for each defect type found in recording>
            for each sample with dbg, no crash, no perfect, not skipped.

    The overall defect counters only uses the samples in the last group.

    Used to:
        - calculate a session quality score (crashes, defects per sample)
        - decide which of two session behaves better

    Notice that the more samples are discarded, the less significant will be
    the score; a good report will need to consider that.

    design notes
        - this is a bit overcomplicated for single session score, but
          probably the minimum while comparing two sessions.
