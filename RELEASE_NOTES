Pyglet 1.3.0
============
This major release takes Python 3 support to the next level. The entire codebase is now compatible
with both Python 2 and Python 3 without the need for 2to3. This should make it easier to develop
pyglet and pyglet apps for both Python versions.

The rest of this release is focussed on code quality and test coverage. There are no API breaking
changes, and only a few minor additions. Dozens of bugs have been fixed, and the codebase is in a
better state for future improvement and maintainability.

New features
------------
- The procedural audio module is now more usable. This module allows synthesis of basic
  waveforms, such as sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and simple FM (two operator sine).
  In addition, several basic amplitude envelopes are now available to apply to generated audio.
  These include ADSR, linear decay, tremolo, and flat envelopes.

Improvements
------------
- Improved font rendering for fonts with negative bearing (#99)
- Sprites now have `scale_x` and `scale_y` attributes, allowing for aspect ratio changes. The 
  existing `scale` attribute sets the overall scaling, and functions as before.
- Sprites have a new `update` method which allows simultaneous changing of position, scale, and
  rotation. This reduces some overhead when changing multiple attributes at once.
- The pyglet.resource module now defaults to a 2048x2048 texture for it's internal texture atlas,
  but will fall back to the maximum available size that the GPU can provide.
- All modern joysticks and game controllers should now be detected on Linux and Windows.
- Refactored and reimplemented pyglet.media. Many improvements to stability. Different drivers
  should now behave more similar.
- WM_CLASS hints are now set on Linux. On modern Linux desktop environments and window managers,
  this allows for proper tracking of pyglet applications. Previously, pyglet apps may show up as
  "Unknown" under the active window list in the environment. The window class hints are set
  to the same name as the Window caption, but will fall back to "pyglet" if the Window caption
  contains non-ascii characters.
- Vastly improved documentation and programming guide.

Bugfixes
--------
- Limit the minimum window size 1x1 pixel, preventing an OpenGL exception when resizing (#49).
- Font module no longer leaks memory when text is changed (#66).
- Fix crash on Python 2 when sys.argv[0] has non-ASCII characters (#74).
- Windows: Fix crash when opening multiple windows in succession (#81).
- Windows: Fix local font loading (#100).
- Windows: Italic fonts no longer render parts of their neighbors.
- Prevent memory leak from orphaned StreamingSources in long running applications (#103).
- Windows: Fix kerning regression (#115)
- Windows: Window.set_icon no longer fails when given a Texture instead of ImageData (#136)

Pyglet 1.2
==========
The major 1.2 release brings pyglet to Python 3. Pyglet now also runs on 64-bit operating systems 
Linux, Windows and OS X. The OS X layer has switched to Cocoa.

Backwards-incompatible API changes:
* renamed Label parameter 'halign' to 'align', fix for issue:460
* remove unused module 'glext_missing' - everything should already be in 'glext_arb'
