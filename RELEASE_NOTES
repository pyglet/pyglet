Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

pyglet 1.4.0
============
Major release adding several new features and removing some long deprecated methods and attributes.
There are also many small bugfixes, and documentation corrections. Thanks to everyone who submitted
a pull request or contributed towards this release!

Of special note, is that the 1.4 release will be the last to support Python 2. It will also be the
last release to support Legacy OpenGL (2.x). Future pyglet releases will be Python 3 only, and will
require at least OpenGL 3 support. If you are using pyglet on legacy systems, don't worry. The 1.4
branch will remain available for download. Bugfixes will be backported as long as someone is willing
to do so, but new fetures on the 1.4 branch are unlikely.

New features
------------
- Added preliminary support for loading 3D models from obj files.
- Switched from avbin to ffmpeg for decoding media files.

Improvements
------------
- Many long deprecated methods and attributes have now been removed. These are all small
  changes, so updating an old codebase is straightforward. The following items were removed:
    * `sprite.set_position`. Set the X, Y coordinates via `sprite.position` instead.
    * `next` on the Player class. This has been replaced by `next_source`.
    * `clock.ClockDisplay`. Use `window.FPSDisplay` instead.
    * `clock.test_clock`. This relied on deprecated behavior, and is superseded by unit tests.
    * `font.text`. Use the `text` module instead for displaying text.
    * `window.Platform` API. Use `canvas.get_display` or `canvas.Display` instead.
    * `font.Win32Font` class. This has been replaced by `font.GDIPlusFont`, which was already default.
       The class still remains, as it's subclassed by `font.GDIPlusFont`. The two should be merged.
    * `window.event.WindowExitHandler`. This functionality is now handled by the Window itself.
    * `image.ImageData.data` properties. Use the `get_data` and `set_data` methods instead.
    * `image.ImageData.image_data` property. Use the `get_image_data` method instead.
    * `image.ImageData.texture` property. Use the `get_texture` method instead.
    * `image.ImageData.mipmapped_texture` property. Use the `get_mipmapped_texture` method instead.
    * `image.ImageData.texture_sequence` property. Use the `get_texture_sequence` method instead.
    * `image.Texture.delete` method. Textures are automatically released through GC.
    * `image.Texture.image_data` property. Use the `get_image_data` method instead.
- Playback of 24bit audio is now supported in the PulseAudio, and DirectAudio drivers. The
  bundled Python Wave codec can also support loading of 24bit wave files. Please note that the
  OpenAL driver does NOT support 24bit audio playback.
- Wave decoding is now based on the Python standard library `wave` module. This is slightly more
  forgiving when loading slightly non-complient files.
- Default texture min and mag filtering can be set on the Texture class. For example:
  `pyglet.image.Texture.default_min_filter = GL_LINEAR`
  `pyglet.image.Texture.default_mag_filter = GL_LINEAR`
- Audio Player and Event classes now take advantage of weak references to ensure proper cleanup of
  resources.
- The `pyglet.resource` module now supports loading of multi-volume Zip files.

Bugfixes
--------
- #253 Add missing self argument to Window event dispatcher methods. Fixes linter warnings.
- #226 Loading Animations failed when a decoder was manually specified.
- #218 Add None-check to xlib `Window.activate` to prevent crash if window is not yet created.
- #190 Remove all usage of `past.basestring`.
- #189 Setting the volume on audio Listeners should work on Python3 in all cases now.
- #170 Fix for UINT point on Windows when using 32-bit Python.
- #167 IndexedVertexDomains with non-1 primcount will now draw correctly on 64bit OSs.
- #168 Fix StopIteration errors due to changes in behavior in Python 3.7. See PEP 479.
- #169 Fix slow Window.flip() on Windows.


pyglet 1.3.1
============
Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------
- #158 Fix mouse events in mouse exclusive mode on Windows.
- #105 Crashes in PulseAudio;
- #163 Workaround for running inside Spyder;
- #45  Expose viewport size for use on HiDPI screens;
- #15  Respect keyboard layout on macOS;


pyglet 1.3.0
============
This major release takes Python 3 support to the next level. The entire codebase is now compatible
with both Python 2 and Python 3 without the need for 2to3. This should make it easier to develop
pyglet and pyglet apps for both Python versions.

The rest of this release is focussed on code quality and test coverage. There are no API breaking
changes, and only a few minor additions. Dozens of bugs have been fixed, and the codebase is in a
better state for future improvement and maintainability.

New features
------------
- The procedural audio module is now more usable. This module allows synthesis of basic
  waveforms, such as sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and simple FM (two operator sine).
  In addition, several basic amplitude envelopes are now available to apply to generated audio.
  These include ADSR, linear decay, tremolo, and flat envelopes.

Improvements
------------
- Improved font rendering for fonts with negative bearing (#99)
- Sprites now have `scale_x` and `scale_y` attributes, allowing for aspect ratio changes. The 
  existing `scale` attribute sets the overall scaling, and functions as before.
- Sprites have a new `update` method which allows simultaneous changing of position, scale, and
  rotation. This reduces some overhead when changing multiple attributes at once.
- The pyglet.resource module now defaults to a 2048x2048 texture for it's internal texture atlas,
  but will fall back to the maximum available size that the GPU can provide.
- All modern joysticks and game controllers should now be detected on Linux and Windows.
- Refactored and reimplemented pyglet.media. Many improvements to stability. Different drivers
  should now behave more similar.
- WM_CLASS hints are now set on Linux. On modern Linux desktop environments and window managers,
  this allows for proper tracking of pyglet applications. Previously, pyglet apps may show up as
  "Unknown" under the active window list in the environment. The window class hints are set
  to the same name as the Window caption, but will fall back to "pyglet" if the Window caption
  contains non-ascii characters.
- Vastly improved documentation and programming guide.

Bugfixes
--------
- Limit the minimum window size 1x1 pixel, preventing an OpenGL exception when resizing (#49).
- Font module no longer leaks memory when text is changed (#66).
- Fix crash on Python 2 when sys.argv[0] has non-ASCII characters (#74).
- Windows: Fix crash when opening multiple windows in succession (#81).
- Windows: Fix local font loading (#100).
- Windows: Italic fonts no longer render parts of their neighbors.
- Prevent memory leak from orphaned StreamingSources in long running applications (#103).
- Windows: Fix kerning regression (#115)
- Windows: Window.set_icon no longer fails when given a Texture instead of ImageData (#136)


pyglet 1.2.3
============

- OSX: Prevent segfault with multiple runs (#37/GC728)

Linux, Windows and OS X. The OS X layer has switched to Cocoa.
